# Features

* Announcing the server to the serverlist

Planned features
* Multi-announce
* Player-anonymization

# Shortcomings

The engine doesn't currently expose the supported protocol versions
and the mod tries to guess the min- and max-values as best as possible
depending on the `minetest.features` table.
